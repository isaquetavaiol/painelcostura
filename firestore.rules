/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Atelier Insights.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has exclusive access
 * to their own data, preventing unauthorized access or modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, creating a clear hierarchy of ownership.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/services/{serviceId}: Services offered by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Expenses incurred by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenseCategories/{expenseCategoryId}: Expense categories defined by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/revenues/{revenueId}: Revenue generated by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}: Projects managed by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/clients/{clientId}: Clients of the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing: Listing all users is explicitly denied.
 * - Path-based ownership: Authorization is determined by the Firestore path, ensuring
 *   that only the user with the matching userId can access the data.
